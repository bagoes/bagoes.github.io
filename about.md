### Introduce

My name is Bagoes from Bandung, Indonesia. I'm just a layman who is learning programming, this website contains my activities in programming, and the contents of the writings on this blog I note are for personal use, but it is possible to share and use it as a learning medium.

For the experts what I write here is a normal thing, but for me this experience is an extraordinary hobby where I am nobody in this field. As for the references that refer to the contents or writings here I will not describe them in this blog, I will return them to the original source and maybe I will also write them on other blogs using Indonesian as my own understanding.

> no time to stop learning

Please provide criticism or suggestions through the [contact][contact] page. Or want to discuss with me through the discussion column on each post.

Let's be friends, find the excitement of my other projects through the social media links that have been listed.

Regards

Bagoes
