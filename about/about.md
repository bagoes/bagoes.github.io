### Introduce
My name is Bagoes from Bandung, Indonesia. I'm just a layman who is learning programming, this website contains my activities in programming, and the contents of the writings on this blog I note are for personal use, but it is possible to share and use it as a learning medium.

For the experts what I write here is a normal thing, but for me this experience is an extraordinary hobby where I am nobody in this field. As for the references that refer to the contents or writings here I will not describe them in this blog, I will return them to the original source and maybe I will also write them on other blogs using Indonesian as my own understanding.

The original writing of this blog is in Indonesian, but here I am also trying to learn to write in English. If there are errors or shortcomings in writing, please understand :D

Please provide criticism or suggestions in the [contact me][contact] section or can be friends with me via the social media links that have been listed.
